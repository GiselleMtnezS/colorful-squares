//This is what was here before: 
// import './index.css';
// import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';
// // If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// // unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
// // Learn more about service workers: https://bit.ly/CRA-PWA
// serviceWorker.register();

//this is what was left: 
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import App from './App'
//socket        plug
ReactDOM.render( < App/ > , document.getElementById('root'))
